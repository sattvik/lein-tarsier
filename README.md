# lein-tarsier

A fully-featured Leiningen plugin to run a VimClojure server for Leiningen
projects.

## Why another VimClojure plug-in?

There are already a number of VimClojure plug-ins out there, some of them
called lein-nailgun and others called lein-vimclojure.  However, most of them
tend to be fairly minimal.  In particular, most of them lacked two key features:

1. Support for both Leiningen 1.x and Leiningen 2.x projects, and
2. The ability to run a standalone REPL in the same process as the server.

## Installation

While you can install this plug-in by adding it to the `:plugins` vector of
your `project.clj`, it probably makes more sense to install it as a user-level
plug-in.

### Leiningen 2

Add `[lein-tarsier "0.9.2"]` to the `plugins` vector of your `:user`
profile located in `~/.lein/profiles.clj`.  For example:

```clj
    {:user {:plugins [[lein-tarsier "0.9.2"]]}}
```

### Leiningen 1

Just run:

    lein plugin install lein-tarsier 0.9.2

## Use

Once the plug-in is installed, running it is as easy as:

    lein vimclojure

The plug-in accepts some arguments, described in the next section.

## Configuration

This plug-in supports the following configuration options:

* `:host`, the host name to use for the VimClojure server, defaults to
  `"127.0.0.1"`
* `:port`, the port the VimClojure server will listen on, defaults to `2113`
* `:repl`, a boolean value determining whether the plug-in should launch a
  REPL, defaults to `false`

You may set these options as follows.

### Profile-based configuration (Leiningen 2 only)

You can set these options using the profile feature of Leiningen 2.  For
example:

```clj
    {:user {:plugins [[lein-tarsier "0.9.2"]]
            :vimclojure-opts {:repl true
	                      :port 42}}}
```

### Project-based configuration

Additionally, you can modify your `project.clj` and add a `:vimclojure-opts`
mapping, for example:

```clj
    (defprojct foo "1.0.0"
      :vimclojure-opts {:repl true
                        :port 42})
```

### Command line override

Finally, you can override any profile- or project-based settings at the command line:

    lein vimclojure :repl true :port 42

## Overriding the VimClojure server version

This plug-in is configured to use version 2.3.1 of the VimClojure server by
default.  However, you can override this by manually specifying the dependency
in your project.

For example, to use version 2.2.0 of the server, you could add the following
dependency to your project:

    [vimclojure/server "2.2.0"]

## About the name

In order to minimise confusion between this plug-in and other `lein-nailgun`
and `lein-vimclojure` plug-ins, this plug-in is named `lein-tarsier`, in honour
of the animal that appears on the cover of _Learning the vi and Vim Editors_.

## TODO

There are a number of features that may be added to the plug-in:

* The ability to run an initialisation script when launching the server
* Adding more features the REPL, such as ClojureDocs support
* The ability to hook onto other Leiningen commands
